plugin.video.elevensports
===

This Kodi plugin plays streams from elevensports.pl.

Please note that the streams are supposed to be temporary until
some serious operators offer these channels.

You need a
[m3u8 plugin](https://github.com/timewasted/repository.timewasted-files/blob/master/addons/script.module.m3u8/script.module.m3u8-0.2.2.zip)
in order to run this plugin.
